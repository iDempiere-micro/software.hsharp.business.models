# H# iDempiere NG Model Interfaces (software.hsharp.business.models and software.hsharp.business.services)

Interfaces for:

- entities (`software.hsharp.business.models`)
- services (`software.hsharp.business.services`)

Please note we use interfaces ending with `Result` (e.g. `ICustomersResult`) for return values. This helps the JavaScript client to make sure the expected type is returned from the server.
